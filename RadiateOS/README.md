- **Indigo** (450-485nm): Developer tools and utilities
- **Azure** (485-500nm): Productivity applications
- **Emerald** (500-565nm): Communication tools
- **Amber** (565-590nm): Media and entertainment
- **Crimson** (590-700nm): Alerts and important actions
- **Infrared** (700nm+): Background processes

## üìä Performance

- **Smooth 60 FPS** animations
- **Optimized memory usage** with smart caching
- **Lazy loading** for improved startup time
- **Efficient state management** with SwiftUI

## üîí Security
