## Quick Test Command
```bash
# Run all automated tests
./run_tests.sh

# Test specific components
swift test --filter KernelTests
swift test --filter PerformanceTests

# Test DMG installation
hdiutil attach RadiateOS/build/macos/RadiateOS.dmg
cp -r /Volumes/RadiateOS/RadiateOS.app /Applications/
hdiutil detach /Volumes/RadiateOS

# Test in VM
open build/vm/RadiateOS.utm
```

## Known Issues to Watch For
1. Network stack migration from NetworkManager to LegacyNetworkStack
2. GPU integration on different hardware
3. Code signing on distribution
4. Memory usage under load

## Post-Testing Actions
- [ ] Document any failures
- [ ] Create bug reports for issues
- [ ] Update version numbers if ready for release
- [ ] Tag release in git
- [ ] Generate release notes

## Sign-off
- [ ] Development testing complete
- [ ] Integration testing complete  
- [ ] Performance testing complete
- [ ] Security testing complete
- [ ] Ready for release
